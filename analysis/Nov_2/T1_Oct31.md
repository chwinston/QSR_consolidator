### 8.3 On-Time Performance

### Overall On-Time Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Completed Milestones** | 234 |
| **On-Time Completions** | 225 |
| **Late Completions** | 2 |
| **Status Unknown** | 7 |
| **Overall On-Time Rate** | 96.2% |

### On-Time Performance by Stage

| Stage | Completed | On-Time | Late | On-Time Rate |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|--------------|
| **Idea** | 94 | 92 | 0 | 97.9% |
| **Develop** | 75 | 72 | 1 | 96.0% |
| **Pilot** | 43 | 40 | 1 | 93.0% |
| **Live** | 23 | 21 | 0 | 91.3% |

### Key Insights

1. **Exceptional on-time performance**: 96.2% overall on-time rate is remarkably high for AI projects.

2. **On-time rate decreases slightly by stage**: From 97.9% (Idea) to 91.3% (Live), but remains >90% throughout.

3. **Only 2 late milestones**: Out of 234 completed milestones, only 2 recorded as "Late"—suggests either excellent execution or lenient targets.

4. **7 milestones have unclear status**: Days-to-target field doesn't contain "OK" or "Late"—data quality issue or different status encoding.

### Days to Target Analysis (Sample)

**Example "Days to Target" Values from Dataset:**
- "OK" (on-time)
- "5 Days Late"
- "2 Days Late"
- Blank or "0"

**Limitation**: The analysis currently treats blanks as "unknown" rather than on-time. Actual on-time rate may be higher if blanks indicate zero delay.

### Assumptions
- "OK" in days_to_target field indicates on-time completion
- Text containing "Late" indicates delay
- Blank values are excluded from on-time calculation (conservative approach)
- Targets may be set with buffer, leading to high on-time rates

### Next Questions
- **Are targets padded?** 96% on-time seems high—are targets conservative?
- **What's causing the 2 late milestones?** Specific projects or systemic issues?
- **Should we track "early" completions?** Are projects finishing significantly before targets?
- **How should we interpret blank days_to_target?** Data quality issue or intentional?

## Stage Velocity Analysis

**Visualization**: [Stage Velocity Comparison by BU](analysis_results/viz_stage_velocity.html)

### 9.1 Average Duration by Stage

| Stage | Avg Days | Median Days | Projects Measured | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Idea** | 9.0 | 0.0 | 33 | Very fast; many complete in same day |
| **Develop** | 5.5 | 0.0 | 27 | Fastest stage; technical validation quick |
| **Pilot** | 36.5 | 14.0 | 15 | Longest stage; significant variation |
| **Live** | 12.1 | 0.0 | 12 | Moderate; many launch quickly |

### Key Insights

1. **Pilot stage is the slowest**: Average 36.5 days, 7x longer than Idea and 7x longer than Develop. Median of 14 days suggests heavy right tail (a few very long pilots).

2. **Median of 0 indicates many same-day completions**: For Idea, Develop, and Live stages, median is 0 days—projects complete all milestones in one day or have milestone dates set simultaneously.

3. **High variance in Pilot stage**: Average 36.5 days vs median 14 days indicates outliers (some pilots taking 60+ days).

4. **Develop stage is surprisingly fast**: Average 5.5 days to complete Technical POC, Dev Roadmap, and Coding Start—suggests lightweight development or parallel activities.

### Duration Distribution (Pilot Stage Detail)

**Sample Pilot Durations:**
- Shortest: 0 days (completed all pilot milestones same day)
- Median: 14 days
- Average: 36.5 days
- Longest: Estimated 90+ days (based on average/median gap)

**Interpretation**: Pilot stage has bimodal distribution—some projects pilot quickly (0-14 days), others iterate extensively (30-90+ days).

### 9.3 Velocity by Project Category

**Visualization**: [Stage Duration by Project Category](analysis_results/viz_stage_velocity.html)

| Project Category | Idea (days) | Develop (days) | Pilot (days) | Live (days) |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **L1: Basic Tools** | 7.8 | 4.8 | 42.0 | 13.2 |
| **L2: Complex Tools** | 1.7 | 7.5 | 14.0 | 0.0 |
| **L3: Internal Process** | 8.0 | 5.5 | 28.0 | 0.0 |
| **L4: Customer Features** | 8.3 | 4.8 | N/A | N/A |
| **L5: New Products** | 16.8 | 7.3 | N/A | 66.0 |

### Key Insights

1. **L5 projects take longest overall**: 16.8 days in Idea (2x portfolio average) and 66 days in Live (6x portfolio average)—building new products requires more time.

2. **L2 projects fastest in Idea**: 1.7 days, likely because complex tools have clear technical requirements from the start.

3. **L1 projects have long Pilot**: 42 days average despite being "basic tools"—suggests adoption challenges even for simple solutions.

4. **L4 and L5 missing Pilot data**: No completed pilot milestones recorded—either still in progress or skipped pilot stage.

5. **Develop stage fairly consistent**: 4.8-7.5 days across all categories, suggesting technical validation is standardized.

### Strategic Implications

**Fast Track (L2, L3):**
- Idea: 1.7-8.0 days
- Develop: 5.5-7.5 days
- Best for quick wins and resource constraints

**Standard Track (L1, L4):**
- Idea: 7.8-8.3 days
- Develop: ~4.8 days
- Balanced approach for proven concepts

**Long Track (L5):**
- Idea: 16.8 days
- Live: 66 days
- Reserve for flagship products with dedicated resources

### Assumptions
- Project category inherently influences velocity (L5 > L4 > L3 > L2 > L1 in complexity)
- Longer durations for L5 are expected, not necessarily problematic
- Missing Pilot data for L4/L5 may indicate ongoing projects vs. process differences

### Next Questions
- **Why do L1 pilots take 42 days?** Adoption resistance or thorough testing?
- **Should L5 projects have dedicated fast-track process?** Or accept longer timelines as necessary?
- **Why is L2 Idea stage so fast?** Can we apply their practices to other categories?
- **Are L4/L5 projects skipping Pilot?** Risky or appropriate for customer-facing changes?

## Strategic Value Analysis

**Visualization**: [Strategic Value vs Project Score Scatter](analysis_results/viz_strategic_value_scatter.html)

### Strategic Value Distribution

| Strategic Value Level | Projects | % of Portfolio | Avg Project Score | Avg Stage Multiplier |
|-----------------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Internal Process** | 10 | 28.6% | 51.4 | 0.60 |
| **Simple Tool** | 8 | 22.9% | 56.3 | 0.71 |
| **Customer Feature - Existing** | 8 | 22.9% | 44.5 | 0.51 |
| **Customer Feature - New** | 6 | 17.1% | 51.8 | 0.60 |
| **Complex Tool** | 3 | 8.6% | 38.0 | 0.50 |

### Key Insights

1. **Simple Tool projects have highest average score**: 56.3 despite being "lower value" category—driven by high stage multiplier (0.71 = mostly Live).

2. **Customer Feature - Existing projects lag**: Lowest score (44.5) and stage multiplier (0.51), suggesting challenges in enhancing existing products with AI.

3. **Internal Process is most common**: 28.6% of portfolio, suggesting strong focus on operational efficiency.

4. **Strategic value doesn't guarantee high scores**: Customer Feature - New (high value) scores 51.8 vs Simple Tool (lower value) at 56.3—execution matters more than category.

5. **Complex Tools underrepresented**: Only 3 projects (8.6%), lowest average score (38.0)—may indicate capability gaps or strategic deprioritization.

### Strategic Value vs. Stage Multiplier Correlation

| Strategic Value | Avg Stage Multiplier | Interpretation |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Simple Tool** | 0.71 | Fastest to Live (mature portfolio) |
| **Internal Process** | 0.60 | Steady progress |
| **Customer Feature - New** | 0.60 | Steady progress |
| **Customer Feature - Existing** | 0.51 | Slower (integration complexity?) |
| **Complex Tool** | 0.50 | Slower (technical challenges?) |

**Insight**: Simpler projects progress faster, but all categories maintain >0.50 multiplier (average between Develop and Pilot stages).

### Score Efficiency Analysis

**Score Efficiency** = Project Score / (Strategic Value × Stage Multiplier)

This normalizes for inherent value differences and stage progression to compare execution quality.

| Business Unit | Avg Score Efficiency | Interpretation |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **ClubWise** | 1.02 | Slightly above expected |
| **Jonas Fitness Inc** | 0.98 | On target |
| **Campsite** | 0.95 | Slightly below expected |
| **ClubOS** | 0.92 | Below expected |
| **EZ Facility** | 0.85 | Significantly below expected |

**Insight**: ClubWise extracts 17% more value from projects than EZ Facility (1.02 vs 0.85 efficiency).

### Assumptions
- Strategic value levels are: Simple Tool < Complex Tool < Internal Process < Customer Feature - Existing < Customer Feature - New (1-5 scale)
- Stage multiplier increases linearly: Idea (0.1) → Develop (0.3) → Pilot (0.6) → Live (1.0)
- Project score accurately reflects total value delivered
- Score efficiency >1.0 indicates overperformance; <1.0 indicates underperformance

### Next Questions
- **Why do Simple Tools score highest?** Fast time-to-value or measurement bias?
- **Can we accelerate Customer Feature - Existing projects?** What's blocking integration?
- **Should we invest more in Complex Tools?** Only 8.6% of portfolio—missed opportunity?
- **How can EZ Facility improve score efficiency?** Process, resources, or measurement issues?

## Data Quality Assessment

### Overall Data Quality: Excellent (95/100)

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Completeness** | 98/100 | Near-perfect for required fields |
| **Consistency** | 95/100 | Minor inconsistencies in days_to_target encoding |
| **Accuracy** | 90/100 | Some zero-day durations may indicate retrospective data entry |
| **Timeliness** | 95/100 | Single-day submission (Oct 31) suggests coordinated reporting |

### Completeness Analysis

**Perfect Completeness (100%)**:
- project_name
- business_name
- project_category
- strategic_value_level
- strategic_value
- project_score
- All KPI fields (kpi1/2/3 category, name, support, measurement, target, actual, delta, notes)

**High Completeness (>85%)**:
- Idea stage milestones: 85.7-94.3%
- Develop stage milestones: 62.9-77.1%

**Lower Completeness (<50%)**:
- Pilot stage milestones: 37.1-42.9%
- Live stage milestones: 11.4-31.4%

**Insight**: Completeness inversely correlates with project maturity—earlier milestones more consistently tracked.

### Data Consistency Findings

**Consistent**:
- Project categories match expected values (L1-L5)
- Strategic value levels align with categories
- Stage multipliers are calculated correctly
- Business names standardized (no typos/variations)

**Inconsistencies Found**:
1. **Days to Target encoding**:
   - Mix of "OK", "X Days Late", blank, and "0"
   - Recommend standardizing to: "OK", "Late: X days", "Early: X days", or numeric delta

2. **Milestone date formats**:
   - Some timestamps include time (e.g., "2025-10-31 15:39:41")
   - Others are date-only
   - Recommend standardizing to date-only for consistency

3. **Zero-day stage durations**:
   - Many projects show 0-day durations (median = 0 for Idea, Develop, Live)
   - Likely indicates simultaneous milestone completion or retrospective entry
   - Consider requiring actual completion date differentiation

### Data Anomalies

**Anomaly 1: Two "Not Started" projects with scores**
- 2 projects have current_stage = "Not Started" but project_score > 0
- Indicates projects may have strategic value assigned before work begins
- **Resolution**: This is acceptable—projects can accrue points for planning even before execution

**Anomaly 2: Projects in Live stage with incomplete Live milestones**
- 11 projects marked as "Live" stage
- But only 4 projects (11.4%) completed "Feedback Loop Continuing" milestone
- **Resolution**: Projects are "Live" after "General Release Available" (31.4% completion)—final milestone is optional

**Anomaly 3: Consistent delta values (-10, -20, -30)**
- Many KPI deltas are round numbers (-10, -20)
- Suggests targets may be set as percentages or relative to baseline
- **Resolution**: This is acceptable—round targets are common in strategic planning

### Missing Data Patterns

**No missing data in**:
- Project identifiers
- Business unit names
- Strategic classifications
- Scoring fields
- KPI structure (all projects have exactly 3 KPIs)

**Systematically missing in**:
- Later-stage milestones (expected for early-stage projects)
- Milestone notes (often blank even when milestone completed)
- Days to target for some completed milestones (7 of 234 = 3%)

**Insight**: Missing data follows logical patterns (progression-based), not random quality issues.

### Data Quality Recommendations

1. **Standardize days_to_target encoding**: Define clear format (e.g., "OK", "Late: X", "Early: X")
2. **Differentiate milestone completion dates**: Avoid all milestones within a stage having same date
3. **Enforce milestone notes for critical milestones**: Especially for Live stage to capture lessons learned
4. **Add validation rules**: Flag projects with >30-day gaps between submission and milestone dates
5. **Track data entry timestamp**: Distinguish between real-time tracking vs. retrospective entry

## Recommendations & Next Questions

### Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Address the KPI Achievement Crisis

**Finding**: Only 7.6% of KPIs exceed targets; 59% are missing targets.

**Recommendations**:
- **Recalibrate targets**: Analyze first-quarter actuals and reset targets for Q2 based on realistic baselines
- **Investigate Cost Savings success**: Understand why it's the only positive category and apply lessons to other KPIs
- **Create KPI playbooks**: Document measurement approaches for top categories (Productivity, Cost, Revenue) to standardize tracking
- **Quarterly target reviews**: Implement formal reviews to adjust ambitious targets based on learnings

**Priority**: CRITICAL (addresses fundamental execution/measurement gap)

---

#### 2. Accelerate Pilot-to-Live Transition

**Finding**: Pilot stage takes 36.5 days (7x longer than other stages); only 31.4% of projects reach Live.

**Recommendations**:
- **ClubOS case study**: Document their 21.5-day pilot process as best practice
- **Pilot stage gates**: Define clear criteria for pilot completion to prevent indefinite testing
- **Resource allocation**: Ensure pilot projects have dedicated resources (not shared with Idea/Develop projects)
- **Fast-track for L1/L2**: Simple tools should have expedited pilot process (<14 days)

**Priority**: HIGH (impacts time-to-value and portfolio throughput)

---

#### 3. Support EZ Facility's Execution

**Finding**: EZ Facility trails in all metrics—lowest scores (24.8 avg), slowest velocity (138 days Idea-to-Live), lowest completion rate (45%).

**Recommendations**:
- **Root cause analysis**: Conduct executive review to identify constraints (resources, skills, processes)
- **Assign mentor BU**: Pair with Jonas Fitness Inc or ClubWise for knowledge transfer
- **Prioritize portfolio**: EZ Facility may benefit from fewer projects (3-4 vs current 5) with deeper focus
- **Quick win project**: Identify one L1 project for 30-day sprint to build momentum

**Priority**: HIGH (prevents T1 BU from falling behind)

---

#### 4. Sustain Live Projects with Feedback Loops

**Finding**: Only 11.4% of projects complete "Feedback Loop Continuing" milestone; Live stage tracking drops off.

**Recommendations**:
- **Mandatory monthly reviews**: Require all Live projects to report KPI actuals monthly
- **Success metric dashboards**: Create real-time dashboards for Live projects visible to executive team
- **Lessons learned repository**: Capture feedback from Live projects to inform future initiatives
- **Sunset policy**: Define criteria for when Live projects can be "graduated" from active tracking

**Priority**: MEDIUM (ensures long-term value capture)

---

#### 5. Diversify ClubWise's Portfolio Risk

**Finding**: ClubWise has 57.1% of portfolio in L5 (new AI products), highest risk concentration.

**Recommendations**:
- **Portfolio balance review**: Assess if 4 concurrent L5 projects (new products) is sustainable with current resources
- **Quick wins supplement**: Add 2-3 L1/L3 projects to generate near-term value while L5 projects mature
- **L5 checkpoints**: Implement quarterly go/no-go reviews for L5 projects to fail fast if needed
- **Resource contingency**: Ensure L5 projects have 20% time buffer to handle unexpected complexity

**Priority**: MEDIUM (proactive risk management for highest-performing BU)

---

#### 6. Standardize KPI Measurement Approaches

**Finding**: Each BU measures same KPI categories differently; limits cross-BU comparison.

**Recommendations**:
- **Create measurement standards**: Define formulas for top 5 KPI categories (Productivity, Cost, Revenue, Adoption, Satisfaction)
- **ClubWise Market Differentiation framework**: Share their approach to competitive positioning KPIs
- **Monthly KPI calibration sessions**: BU leads meet monthly to align on measurement practices
- **Benchmarking database**: Build historical KPI performance by category/BU for target-setting

**Priority**: MEDIUM (improves comparability and target accuracy)

---

#### 7. Investigate "Not Started" Projects

**Finding**: 2 projects (5.7%) are marked "Not Started" despite having scores and resource allocation.

**Recommendations**:
- **Project health check**: Verify if these projects are truly not started or data entry lag
- **Definition clarity**: Define "Project Defined" milestone criteria to prevent ambiguous status
- **Kickoff requirement**: Mandate that projects must complete "Project Defined" within 14 days of resource allocation
- **Portfolio cleanup**: Consider removing projects that remain "Not Started" for >30 days

**Priority**: LOW (small number but signals process clarity needed)

---

### Strategic Questions for Leadership Review

#### Portfolio Strategy

1. **What's our target portfolio mix?** Should we mandate % targets for L1/L3/L5 categories, or let BUs self-optimize?

2. **Is 35 projects the right portfolio size?** With 59% of KPIs missing targets, are we spreading resources too thin?

3. **Should we double down on Live projects or invest in Idea stage?** 31.4% already Live vs 31.4% in Idea—where's highest ROI?

#### Measurement & Targets

4. **Are our targets aspirational or commitments?** 7.6% achievement suggests need for target-setting philosophy alignment.

5. **How do we weight KPI importance?** All 3 KPIs tracked equally—should we prioritize based on strategic value?

6. **When should we recalibrate targets?** Quarterly, annually, or only when missing by >20%?

#### Resource Allocation

7. **Should we reallocate resources to EZ Facility?** Or accept their different maturity curve?

8. **Can we dedicate a "Pilot team"?** Specialists to accelerate the 36.5-day Pilot stage across all BUs?

9. **What's our acceptable time-to-Live?** ClubOS at 41 days vs EZ Facility at 138 days—should we set standards?

#### Governance & Accountability

10. **Who owns KPI achievement?** Project leads, BU executives, or shared accountability?

11. **Should milestone completion be tied to incentives?** Jonas Fitness Inc at 60.8% vs EZ Facility at 45%—reward excellence?

12. **How do we handle the 11.4% "Feedback Loop" completion?** Mandate or accept as optional maturity milestone?
